## ðŸŒ† Wallheaven - Random wallpaper fetcher for wallhaven.cc

Wallheaven is a CLI tool for fetching random wallpapers from [wallhaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc/). Wallheaven will randomly choose a wallpaper from various lists including your own collections using your API key. The selected wallpaper will then be downloaded and will output the file path. Alternatively if a script is provided then the script will be called with the file path. [more info](https://github.com/davenicholson-xyz/wallheaven/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-wallpaper-with-external-script)

All queries and selected wallpapers are cached to cut down on API calls. 

### New Chrome extension for wallhaven.cc

You can now select a wallpaper straight from the wallhaven.cc website using the chrome-extension found in the [chrome extension folder](https://github.com/davenicholson-xyz/wallheaven/tree/main/chrome-extension). Download and install on the Chrome extensions page.

## Setting wallpaper with external script

The wallheaven app only spits out the location of the selected wallpaper on your drive (the cache folder). To set the wallpaper you will need to pass it to whichever program you are using to set wallpaper on your OS. This can either be done by setting the `post_script` option in `config.toml` to the script you wish to set the wallpaper (`post_script="swww img"`) or you can set the `-s --script` flag (`wallheaven -t -s "swww img"`)

You can also just pipe the output directly into a script.

`wallheaven -t | swww img` for example. Or if it does not allow piping `feh --bg-fill $(wallhaven -t)`

Mac and Windows will require a slightly different approach but Google is your friend.
